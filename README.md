- **Problem Statement** -*On-Device Multi-Agent System for Behavior-Based Anomaly & Fraud Detection. Multi-agent system that runs fully on-device, continuously learning and modeling user behaviour patterns to detect anomalies or potential fraud in real-time, without sending sensitive data to external servers. The system can monitor user behaviour patterns (e.g., touch patterns, typing rhythm, app usage, movement) and build local models of “normal” behaviour. It should detect and react to anomalous or suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized access, bot-like behaviour, spoofing).*
